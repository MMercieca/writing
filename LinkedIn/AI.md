AI may be headed to do to the software industry what 3D printing did to the manufacturing industry.

Story time. My wife was working with a new clay and wanted a ruler to estimate how much a finished piece would shrink. She had a paper version to print, but we don't have a laminator and clay is a bit messy.

I have a 3D printer and OpenSCAD--- I'm not great with traditional CAD programs but I can script things. Go figure. In less than an hour I was able to make a plastic ruler for her. Being me, the code was generic and I could adjust the shrinkage rate if she needed a new one.

Out of curiosity I did a search to see if anyone was selling something similar. There are a lot of 3D printing files and tools for sale in pottery. I was surprised that I didn't find any. So I printed some more examples in various plastics and shrinkage rates, took some pictures, and made an Etsy store.

In less than a week I was able to go from having an idea to having a product to sell. All because I had a 3D printer.

3D printing let me, someone without a factory, create a product. I was able to do it for a niche that probably isn't profitable for a larger company to go after. It let me do all of that in a week.

AI will let more people create more products. It already is. It will let people create niche applications that may not have been profitable to go after before. AI certainly has accelerated the pace of development and will likely continue to do so.

There's a flip side. At every art fair we go to now, we see people selling 3D printed wares. That's not bad. But they're all selling the same 3D printed wares, copies of what people can download online. Larger manufacturers have caught on and those toys are now available at local mega-marts.

I think we're seeing that with AI too: AI ads, AI resumes, AI LinkedIn posts, etc. 

So will AI change the software industry? It already has. Will it eliminate my job? I don't think so.
