Someone in a maker discord wanted to learn some Python. Given what I do and wanting to support the community, I tried figuring out what advice made the best use of my schooling and years of experience. I ended up with: learn source control first.

Learning a new skill requires: practice, freedom to experiment, and freedom to fail. Source control facilitates all three.

When I'm working with other engineers and they ask the question, "Can I do X?", my default answer is, "Try it." If we're working in a safe environment--- which your machine should be--- then anyone will learn a lot more by trying something than just getting an answer for me.

A lot of mentoring is trying to make yourself unnecessary. That might sound like terrible job advice but, if it is bad advice, it was a poor workplace anyway. My goal is to set people up so they can practice, experiment, and when things inevitably blow up easily try again.

As a bonus, popular source control platforms like Github and Gitlab are the standard way of collaborating with other like minded people. They're also a great place if anyone just wants to share their work, which makers often do.

Having said that, I wasn't really able to find a beginner friendly Git tutorial. I can't imagine doing my job or my home projects without it, so that may be my next contribution to the maker community.
